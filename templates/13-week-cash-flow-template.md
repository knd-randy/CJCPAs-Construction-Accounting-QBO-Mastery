### Key Formulas

```
Beginning Cash (Week 2+):
= Previous Week Ending Cash

Total Receipts:
= SUM of all receipt line items for that week

Total Disbursements:
= SUM of all disbursement line items for that week

Net Cash Flow:
= Total Receipts - Total Disbursements

Ending Cash:
= Beginning Cash + Net Cash Flow

Surplus/(Shortfall):
= Ending Cash - Minimum Cash Target
```

### Conditional Formatting

```
Apply RED formatting to Surplus/(Shortfall) cells that are negative
Apply YELLOW formatting to weeks where Surplus < $10,000
```

2. **Be conservative** - Don't count uncertain receipts
3. **Include everything** - All known disbursements
4. **Watch payroll weeks** - May have extra payroll in some months
5. **Plan for taxes** - Quarterly tax payments, payroll deposits
6. **Track actuals** - Compare forecast to actual for accuracy
7. **Act early** - Address shortfalls before they happen
